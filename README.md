# transmission-light-controller
This is the desk push-button controller for the transmission light.

There are a series of buttons built into the desk now where the director/producer/whoever can press the button and change the status of the light without typing in any address, all of it is handled by the Raspberry Pi.

## Schematic

Please note, the 5V input is plugged into the USB midro B port on the Raspberry Pi and there is an ethernet cable plugged in, due to the limitations of the software I am using, this cannot be properly represented.
